Stock Analaysis


In this project, I will use a keras Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the stock price. In order to download past stock data I am using yahoo finance api.

To begin the project, I imported numpy for making scientific computations, pandas for loading and modifying datasets, and matplotlib for plotting graphs.And the data was noramlized and the trained model was use to make prediction and the result was plotted on the graph.
